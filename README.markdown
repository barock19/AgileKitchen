AgileKitchen is just another Scrumboard tool for your agile team based Ruby on Rails. why "Kitchen"?, maybe it crossed in your head. in my office, we try to make our Scrumboard more fun, so we try to change the common terms in scrum. such as term for tracking the process of a story, is it flagged as _"working"_, *"done"*, _"testing"_ or _"tested"_ ? we changed it to *"cooking"*, *"cooked"*, *"tasting"*, and *"tasted"*.

This App's goal is trying to make Scrum more fun, easy and not trapped just on board
